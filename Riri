Stats on multiple blockchains at once
Allows to retrieve the most important stats on all blockchains we support via just one API request.

Endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/stats
If you require data on just one blockchain, please use https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/stats instead.

Output:

data contains an array with stats on 15 blockchains we support at once:

Bitcoin
Bitcoin Cash
Ethereum
Litecoin
Bitcoin SV
Dogecoin
Dash
Ripple
Groestlcoin
Stellar
Monero
Cardano
Zcash
Mixin
Tezos
eCash
and on 3 cross-chain tokens:

Output:

data contains an array with blockchain statistics:

blocks — total number of blocks (note that it's 1 more than the latest block number as there is block #0)
transactions — total number of transactions
outputs — total number of outputs (including spent)
circulation — number of coins in circulation (in satoshi)
blockchain_size — total size of all blocks in bytes (note: it's not the size of a full node, it's just bare blocks; nodes are bigger in size as they use database indexing, etc)
nodes— number of full network nodes (it's an approximate number and actually not a blockchain metric)
difficulty — current mining difficulty
hashrate_24h — approximated hashrate over the last 24 hours (returned as a string as it doesn't fit into an integer)
next_retarget_time_estimate — approximate timestamp of the next difficulty retarget (this field is available for Bitcoin and Litecoin only)
next_difficulty_estimate — approximate next difficulty value (this field is available for Bitcoin and Litecoin only)
best_block_height — the latest block height
best_block_hash — the latest block hash

market_price_usd — average market price of 1 coin in USD (market data source: CoinGecko)
market_price_btc — average market price of 1 coin in BTC (for Bitcoin it always returns 1)
market_price_usd_change_24h_percentage — market price change in percent for 24 hours
market_cap_usd — market capitalization (coins in circulation * price per coin in USD)
market_dominance_percentage — dominance index (how much % of the total cryptocurrency market is the market capitalization of the coin)
countdowns (optional) — an optional array of events ([event, time_left] format), where time_left is the number of seconds till the event
