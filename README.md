This action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions users:

- Optionally downloading and caching distribution of the requested Node.js version, and adding it to the PATH
- Optionally caching npm/yarn/pnpm dependencies
- Registering problem matchers for error output
- Configuring authentication for GPR or npm

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

**Basic:**
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
- run: npm install
- run: npm test
```

The `node-version` input is optional. If not supplied, the node version from PATH will be used. However, it is recommended to always specify Node.js version and don't rely on the system one.  

The action will first check the local cache for a semver match. If unable to find a specific version in the cache, the action will attempt to download a version of Node.js. It will pull LTS versions from [node-versions releases](https://github.com/actions/node-versions/releases) and on miss or failure will fall back to the previous behavior of downloading directly from [node dist](https://nodejs.org/dist/).

For information regarding locally cached versions of Node.js on GitHub hosted runners, check out [GitHub Actions Virtual Environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).

#### Supported version syntax
The `node-version` input supports the following syntax:

major versions: `12`, `14`, `16`  
more specific versions: `10.15`, `14.2.0`, `16.3.0`  
nvm lts syntax: `lts/erbium`, `lts/fermium`, `lts/*`  

## Caching packages dependencies

The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) under hood for caching dependencies but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` (v6.10+). The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.

The action defaults to search for the dependency file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) in the repository root, and uses its hash as a part of the cache key. Use `cache-dependency-path` for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories.

See the examples of using cache for `yarn` / `pnpm` and  `cache-dependency-path` input in the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-dependencies) guide.

**Caching npm dependencies:**
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
    cache: 'npm'
- run: npm install
- run: npm test
```

**Caching npm dependencies in monorepos:**
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: subdir/package-lock.json
- run: npm install
- run: npm test
```

## Matrix Testing:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [ '12', '14', '16' ]
    name: Node ${{ matrix.node }} sample
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```
